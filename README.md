## What is ResilientSteps?

Most navigation apps optimise for speed. ResilientSteps optimises for **safety, shade, heat and community well-being**.

Instead of asking "how do I get there fastest?" it asks "how do I get there most safely?". Routing pedestrians through well-lit streets, footpaths, and residential roads while avoiding high-speed arterials, poorly-lit stretches, and areas with recent incident reports.

Built for Pune, India. Designed for anyone who has ever felt uncertain walking home.

  Flutter app
  with live navigation,
  safety overlays,
  and incident reporting
```

Every street segment in Pune carries a **safety score** (0–100) derived from:

| Signal | How it's used |
|--------|--------------|
| Nearby incident reports | Reports within 75 m of a segment raise its incident risk (saturates at 5) |
| Road type | Drives lighting & crowd heuristics (arterials read busier/well-lit, footpaths/paths quieter — see scoring reference) |
| Nearby intersections | Intersections boost estimated crowd density |
| Time of day (IST) | Late-night segments score lower than daytime ones at ingest time |

In-motion, the route score additionally subtracts a penalty from **verified
community incident reports** near the road segments being walked.

Before you start walking, the app also shows a **comfort score** built from two
climate signals:

| Signal | How it's used |
|--------|--------------|
| Shade score | OSM tree canopy + green areas around each street segment (live data, not predefined) |
| Heat index | Live Open-Meteo "feels-like" temperature, banded Pleasant / Mild / High / Extreme |

Routes minimise total risk across all segments, not just distance.

### Concrete data flow

1. **Routing** — the app sends `GET /route-safe?start_lat=…&end_lat=…`. The
   backend asks self-hosted Valhalla for a pedestrian route, then `score_route`
   matches the route geometry to precomputed `road_segments` (STRtree cache,
   re-warmed automatically when the dataset version changes) and returns
   per-segment safety/shade/heat plus route comfort. The app renders the
   polyline, the zone overlay (from `/safety-zones`, cached offline in
   `shared_preferences`), and the card metrics.
2. **Destination search / geocoding** — the app calls Nominatim directly
   (search + reverse geocode, cached and rate-gated client-side). No backend
   proxy involved.
3. **Incident reporting** — the app `POST /reports` (Supabase JWT) → stored as
   `pending` in `incident_reports` → an operator verifies/rejects via the admin
   API using the `X-Admin-Key` header → verified reports influence future route
   scores (nearest-segment match within 30 m, weighted by confidence/category/status/recency).
   Nothing touches road segments at moderation time.
4. **SOS** — the app records `POST /reports/emergency` (GPS location + trusted
   contacts → `emergency_alerts`) and the **device** sends SMS to trusted
   contacts on its own. If GPS is unavailable the SOS is blocked.
5. **Precomputed vs live** — segment scores, zone hexagons and shade scores are
   precomputed by the `logic/` pipeline into PostGIS; weather heat penalty is
   fetched live per request (cached 15 min, degrades to 0 on failure);
   reports/scores interplay is live at scoring time.

## Features

### Safety-first routing
Routes scored segment-by-segment against the weighted safety model — picking routes that avoid high-incident stretches. The safety score for your route is shown before you start walking.

### Live danger zone overlay
H3 hexagon polygons colour-coded green / amber / red based on aggregated street safety scores. Toggleable. Cached offline.

### Real-time navigation
- Live GPS position tracking with map auto-pan
- Heading-up mode — map rotates to face your direction of travel
- Route consumption — walked sections fade as you progress
- Automatic rerouting when you drift too far off-route (dynamic threshold,
  roughly 40–80 m depending on GPS fix quality, with a 15 s cooldown)
- Arrival detection near the destination

### SOS alert
One-tap emergency alert. Your phone sends SMS messages to your saved trusted
contacts **directly from the device** (no backend needed for delivery), records
your real GPS location and the contact list against the backend
(`POST /reports/emergency`), and blocks the SOS if GPS is unavailable — never
sends a fake location. The backend records the event; it does not deliver
messages.

### Incident reporting
Report poor lighting, suspicious activity, or unsafe infrastructure. Reports enter a moderation queue — they do not affect safety scores until an operator verifies them.

### AI-powered incident classification (Nugen)
Optional backend LLM classifier (Nugen) enriches each submitted report with a
canonical category code, severity (1–5) and model confidence. It runs after the
report is persisted — if Nugen is unconfigured or unavailable, the report keeps
its insert-time values (confidence 0.5) and the pipeline never breaks.

To enable it, add two keys to `backend/.env`:

```env
# Key: platform.nugen.in -> dashboard -> API keys
# Model: pick one with inference_ready=true AND alignment_ready=true:
#   meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct (recommended)
# Optional override (default: https://api.nugen.in/api/v3/inference)
# NUGEN_BASE_URL=https://api.nugen.in/api/v3/inference
NUGEN_API_KEY=your-api-key
NUGEN_MODEL=meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct
```

- Set **both** `NUGEN_API_KEY` and `NUGEN_MODEL` for classification to run.
- Classification stays **OFF** until both are set — everything degrades to the
  base confidence of 0.5 without them (offline-safe by design).
- The model must be OpenAI-compatible (Nugen serves SSE/chat-completions) — the
  recommended first pick is `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct`.
- The mobile app is never involved; this is purely a backend enrichment step.

### Operator moderation
Simple API-based moderation workflow. Verified reports then affect scores
dynamically (see API reference) — segment data itself is not rewritten.

### ngrok-controlled demo URL (optional)
`ngrok` exposes the local backend over a permanent HTTPS URL. Point the mobile app
at that URL so the APK works anywhere — not just on your local network. No public
IP, no cloud VPS, and no VPN required. Detailed setup is in
**[Sharing & distribution](SETUP.md#sharing--distribution)** in SETUP.md.

## Getting started

All installation, configuration, run-book, dashboard access, APK sharing and
troubleshooting documentation lives in **[SETUP.md](SETUP.md)** — including a
pitfalls section covering the failure modes of every step (Windows port
conflicts, cold-start timing, dart-define staleness, emulator vs device
addresses, ngrok behaviour, and more).

Quick path:

```text
1. backend/.env  (copy from backend/.env.example — REQUIRED before steps 3 & 6)
2. Database     → alembic upgrade head (backend/.venv)
3. Valhalla     → docker compose up -d valhalla        (10–20 min first run)
4. Safety data  → python generate_safety_map.py        (logic/)
5. Shade data   → python generate_shade_map.py         (logic/, after step 4)
6. Backend      → uvicorn app.main:app :8000, wait for /ready {"ready":true}
7. App          → mobile/config/dart_defines.json + flutter run -d chrome
   Dashboard    → http://localhost:8000/dashboard-ui/  (served by the backend)
```

Endpoint/verification basics stay here: see [API reference](#api-reference)
below. The test-verification commands are in
[Running tests in SETUP.md](SETUP.md#running-tests).

---

## API reference

Interactive docs (FastAPI default, enabled): `http://localhost:8000/docs`

### Routing

```

GET /route?start_lat=&start_lon=&end_lat=&end_lon=
```

Returns a pedestrian route from Valhalla with encoded polyline.

```

POST /route/risk
Body: { "coordinates": [[lat, lon], ...] }
```

Scores a route's safety using the cached road segment data and live verified incidents.

```

GET /route-safe?start_lat=&start_lon=&end_lat=&end_lon=&prefer=balanced
```

Combined route fetch + safety scoring in a single call. Each segment includes
`safety_score`, `shade_score`, `heat_penalty`, and `comfort_score`; the top
level adds the route-wide comfort score/level. `prefer` selects the comfort
weighting: `balanced`, `safety`, `shade`, or `heat`.

```

GET /safety-zones?min_lat=&max_lat=&min_lon=&max_lon=
```

Returns GeoJSON FeatureCollection of H3 polygon safety zones within the bounding box.

### Reporting

```

POST /reports
Authorization: Bearer <supabase-jwt>
Body: { "category": "Poor lighting", "lat": 18.52, "lon": 73.85, "description": "..." }
```

Submit an incident report (auth required). Rate limited to 5 requests/hour per
IP. Enters as `pending`.

```

GET /reports/recent?limit=50
```

Most recent reports for the map feed (limit clamped to 200, no auth).

```

POST /reports/emergency
Authorization: Bearer <supabase-jwt>
Body: { "lat": 18.52, "lon": 73.85, "trusted_contacts": [{"name": "...", "phone": "..."}] }
```

Record an SOS alert with real GPS coordinates and trusted contact list.
Rate limited to 3 requests/10 minutes per IP. The backend only **records** the
alert — message delivery to contacts is done by the phone via on-device SMS.

### Admin moderation

All admin endpoints require `X-Admin-Key: your-admin-key` header.

```

GET  /admin/reports?status=pending
POST /admin/reports/{id}/verify
POST /admin/reports/{id}/reject
```

Verification flips the report's status — it does **not** rewrite road-segment
data. Verified reports affect scores dynamically at scoring time: an incident
report influences the nearest road segment within 30 metres of its location
(weighted by confidence, category, status and recency), and shade-relevant
categories ("no shade / heavy sun", "cool shaded spot / water available") add a
shade correction to that segment. Pending and rejected reports have no effect.

**Example moderation workflow:**

```bash
# List pending reports
curl "http://localhost:8000/admin/reports?status=pending" \
  -H "X-Admin-Key: your-admin-key"

# Verify report ID 42
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/admin/reports/42/verify" \
  -H "X-Admin-Key: your-admin-key"
```

## Safety scoring reference

Scores come from `logic/safety_feature_engine.py` (pipe:line-time base scores)
plus `backend/.../services/risk_engine.py` (route-time adjustments). There is
**no static road-type lookup table** — the score is a weighted-risk blend:

### Base segment score (`safety_feature_engine.py`)

risk = 0.45 × incident-risk + 0.25 × lighting-risk + 0.20 × crowd-risk
+ 0.10 × time-of-day-risk; score = (1 − risk) × 100, clamped to [0, 100].

Each component is estimated per segment:

| Component | Source | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Incident risk | OSM incidents within 75 m of the segment (saturates at 5) | Cluster-driven, see below |
| Lighting score | Road-type heuristics (e.g. motorway 90, residential 58, footway 48, path 42 — **higher = better lit** since arterials carry lit stats) | Unknown road types default to 55 |
| Crowd density | Road-type base + 6 per nearby intersection (max +30) | Residential ≈ 50, pedestrian ≈ 72 |
| Time-of-day factor | 1.0 (07:00–18:00 IST), 0.7 (05–06 / 19–20), 0.5 (21–22), 0.3 (late night) | |

### Incident heat (community reports)

Verified/known incident reports cluster within 120 m and radiate influence
~140 m (grows with cluster size). Each report carries a weight of
confidence × status (verified 1.0, resolved 0.4, pending 0.65) × category
(stalking 1.0, harassment 0.9, suspicious 0.8, poor lighting 0.6) × recency
(≤7 days 1.0 → >90 days 0.3). Segment penalty = min(18, weight × 8).

### Route-time adjustments (`risk_engine.py`)

- Verified incident reports are matched to road segments within **30 m** and
  apply an additional incident penalty.
- Shade corrections from verified "no shade" / "cool shaded spot" reports are
  added to the base shade score (clamped).

### Zone classification

| Safety score | Zone colour | Risk level |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| ≥ 70 | 🟢 Green | Safe |
| 40–69 | 🟡 Amber | Cautious |
| < 40 | 🔴 Red | Risky |

## Shade & heat scoring reference

Every route segment also carries a shade score and the route carries live heat
data, which combine into the comfort score shown before you start walking.

### Shade score (`logic/generate_shade_map.py`)

Scores a ~15 m buffer around each street segment against OSM canopy features
(`natural=tree/wood/scrub`, `landuse=forest/grass`, `leisure=park/garden`):

| Component | Contribution |
|-----------|-------------|
| Tree points in buffer | 0.7 × min(1.0, trees ÷ 6) |
| Green-area coverage of buffer | 0.3 × min(1.0, coverage ÷ 0.6) |

Result clamped to [0, 100] and written as `shade_score` with
`shade_source='osm_canopy'`. The visual Shade % on a route is the average
across matched segments.

> **Data caveat:** OSM's canopy tagging in Pune is sparse — most segments
> score 0. A 0% reading is expected in unmapped areas, not a data error.

### Heat penalty (`backend/.../services/weather_service.py`)

Live Open-Meteo `apparent_temperature` (keyless, no API account):

| Feels-like temp | Heat penalty |
|----------------|-------------|
| ≥ 42 °C | 30 |
| ≥ 38 °C | 20 |
| ≥ 32 °C | 12 |
| ≥ 28 °C | 5 |
| below 28 °C | 0 |

UV index ≥ 8 adds +5. Weather failures **degrade, never block**: heat penalty
falls back to `0.0`, displayed as "Pleasant".

### Comfort score

Weighted blend of the safety, shade and heat signals. The `prefer` query
parameter on `/route-safe` selects the weighting profile: `balanced`,
`safety`, `shade`, or `heat`.

---

## Known limitations

- **Pune-only geography.** The Valhalla tile set covers an OSM western-India
  extract while the OSMnx scoring pipeline is scoped to Pune. Extending to other
  cities requires re-running the data pipeline and re-preprocessing Valhalla
  tiles.
- **Demo dependency on local laptop.** The ngrok distribution model requires the
  host machine to remain online. A proper cloud deployment (VPS with Docker
  Compose) would remove this constraint.
- **Road-type heuristics, not point tags.** The pipeline does not currently
  read point-level OSM tags like `lit=` or `sidewalk=` — lighting and crowd
  inputs come from road-type heuristics and intersection density. Unmapped/unknown
  road types fall back to middle-of-the-road defaults.
- **Sparse canopy data.** OSM tree/park tagging is sparse in Pune — most street
  segments shade-score 0, so route Shade % is often `0%`/`<1%` unless the route
  passes mapped greenery. Upgrading to satellite-derived canopy would fix this.
- **Heading on emulators.** Map rotation during navigation requires a real
  device with a compass. Android emulators return a constant heading of 0 or -1.
- **Media uploads.** Attaching photos to incident reports is planned for a future
  release. The button is hidden in v1.

---

## Privacy, security & safety disclaimer

Grounded in what the code actually does:

- **Location data sent to the backend:** your origin/destination coordinates go
  to the backend with every route request. Active navigation uses the device GPS
  fixes on-device only (camera anchoring, off-route detection); report/SOS
  submissions include the GPS coordinate recorded at that moment. The backend
  does not continuously track you.
- **Incident reports** are stored with the coordinates and link back to your
  Supabase user ID (JWT-derived hash on the server); they enter `pending` and
  are only surfaced on the map/reports feed.
- **SOS alerts** are stored in `emergency_alerts` together with the GPS
  coordinate, a timestamp and the trusted-contact list you supplied for that
  alert. Delivery happens via on-device SMS; the backend does not message
  anyone.
- **Trusted-contact details** are stored in the alert record and on-device
  (`shared_preferences`); they are not used beyond SMS fan-out and emergency
  records.
- **Secrets:** the Supabase service-role key, JWT secret, `ADMIN_API_KEY` and
  `DATABASE_URL` are server-side secrets in `backend/.env` (gitignored). The
  mobile app only needs the two public values (`SUPABASE_URL`,
  `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) plus the MapTiler key and `API_BASE_URL`.
- **Safety-score honesty:** scores are *estimates* derived from OSM tags and
  community reports — they can be stale, biased or wrong. They are decision
  support only, **not** a guarantee that a street is safe or dangerous.
- **Not an emergency service.** The SOS feature is an aid, never a substitute
  for contacting police/ambulance services (call 112 in India).

## Roadmap

- [ ] Cloud VPS deployment with Docker Compose (remove ngrok dependency)
- [ ] Play Store release with release keystore and proper signing
- [ ] Scheduled safety data refresh (weekly OSMnx re-ingest via cron — currently manual)
- [ ] Media upload support for incident reports (Supabase Storage)
- [ ] Backend-driven emergency fan-out (push notifications; on-device SMS already works today)
- [ ] Per-request time-of-day scoring (the pipeline currently bakes a time factor at ingest; route-time night penalties are not computed live)
- [ ] Expand beyond Pune to other Indian cities
